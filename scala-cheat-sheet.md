# **Scala cheat sheet**

## **Evaluation rules**
* Call by value: evaluates the function arguments before calling the function
* Call by name: evaluates the function first, and then evaluates the arguments if need be
``` scala 
def example = 2      // evaluated when called
val example = 2      // evaluated immediately
lazy val example = 2 // evaluated once when needed

def square(x: Double)    // call by value
def square(x: => Double) // call by name
def myFct(bindings: Int*) =  ...  // bindings is a sequence of int, containing a varying # of arguments (```)
```
## **Higher order functions**
These are functions that take a function as a parameter or return functions.
``` scala
// sum takes a function that takes an integer and returns an integer then
// returns a function that takes two integers and returns an integer
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int =
  def sumf(a: Int, b: Int): Int = f(a) + f(b)
  sumf

// same as above. Its type is (Int => Int) => (Int, Int) => Int
def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int =  ...

// Called like this
sum((x: Int) => x * x * x)          // Anonymous function, i.e. does not have a name
sum(x => x * x * x)                 // Same anonymous function with type inferred

def cube(x: Int) = x * x * x
sum(x => x * x * x)(1, 10) // sum of 1 cubed and 10 cubed
sum(cube)(1, 10)           // same as above  
```
## **Currying**
Converting a function with multiple arguments into a function with a single argument that returns another funtion.
```scala
val f2: (Int, Int) => Int = f // uncurried version (type is (Int, Int) => Int)
val f3: Int => Int => Int = f2.curried // transform it to a curried version (type is Int => Int => Int)
val f4: (Int, Int) => Int = Function.uncurried(f3) // go back to the uncurried version (type is (Int, Int) => Int)
```
